### Have fun!


notes:
- Start Game by running menu.py
- We have implemented an opponent that does not move. It looks like a cactus.  
- Unfortunately we could not finish the enemy class. At the appropriate place in the code the functionalities of the class are described.

todo: 
- Finish writing the methods of the opponent class, so you would have opponents that move.


Closing words: 

Afterward we could save ourselves a lot of time if we had used more functions from function libraries. 

This is the first project of both of us where we program with someone else, sometimes it was a pain in the ass. 

We didn't talk very well at the beginning and often had problems to implement code from each other. So we had to delete a lot of code. 

Both of us lerned a lot and enjoyed the programming languages anyway :)
